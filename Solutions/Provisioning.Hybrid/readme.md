# INTRODUCTION #
This reference implementation shows how one can use the add-in model to provision site collections in SharePoint Online and in SharePoint on-premises. The same code base is used for both options: depending on the choice the user makes in the provisioning form the solution will either create the site collection in SharePoint Online or in SharePoint on-premises. The SharePoint provisioning add-in in this sample is designed to run in Azure cloud services which will result in cloud driven solution. In order to provision sites collections on-premises the add-in running on Windows Azure cloud services uses Windows Azure service bus to make the connection to an on-premises component. Below schema shows the above flows in action:

## REFERENCES TO OTHER OFFICE AMS SAMPLES ##
This sample must be seen a reference implementation that makes use of some of the other Office AMS samples. Therefore we would like to refer to the documentation of these samples for the following elements:
-  **Core.CloudServices:** this sample explains how to setup a Visual Studio 2013 project that uses Azure Cloud services and SharePoint apps. It also elaborates on how to use an add-in only OAUTH token for the provisioning part and how to handle encryption and decryption of configuration data when running on Windows Azure cloud services
-  **Core.PeoplePicker:** this sample provides you with a detailed explanation on how to use the people picker component for provider hosted apps
-  **Provisioning.Pages:** explanation on how to create wiki pages, how to add and remove web parts or html snippets from these pages is shown in this sample
-  **Provisioning.SubSiteCreationApp:** this sample shows how to hookup sub site provisioning and how to apply branding by uploading and applying a custom theme 
-  **Provisioning.Services.SiteManager:** as there’s no remote API for site collection provisioning for SharePoint On-premises this sample uses the WCF endpoint that’s being provided as part of this sample.

# SOLUTION SETUP #
The solution contains 10 projects:

![](http://i.imgur.com/96f5nFG.png)

Below you can find a short description of each of the projects:
-  **Provisioning.Hybrid:** this is the Azure cloud services project that holds the configuration data for three cloud services: one web role (Provisioning.Hybrid.Web) and one worker role named Provisioning.Hybrid.Worker
-  **Provisioning.Hybrid.Web:** this is ASP.Net web project that will be part of the SharePoint application and that will be hosted as a web role on Azure Cloud services
-  **Provisioning.Hybrid.Web.SharePoint:** this is the SharePoint add-in project. Together with the previous project these 2 projects together are the SharePoint add-in. Since this a provider hosted add-in this project only contains the add-in manifest and a dummy module to trigger the creation of an appweb (required for the people picker control)
-  **Provisioning.Hybrid.Worker:** this is the Azure Cloud services worker role project. This project will, by making use of the Provisioning.Hybrid.Core and the Office AMS Core library projects, do the actual site collection creation work
-  **Provisioning.Hybrid.Contract:** this project holds the data contract classes which are used to pass information from the SharePoint add-in to the service endpoint.
-  **Provisioning.Hybrid.Core:** this project contains the core provisioning classes and all their supporting artefacts such as themes and mail template files
-  **Provisioning.Hybrid.Console:** this project is a console project that uses Windows Azure Service Bus to listen for requests coming from the SharePoint Provisioning solution. This typically is the part that you would run on-premises
-  **Provisioning.Hybrid.Test.Console:** this is a test console application that you can use to push a message via service bus to the “Provisioning.Hybrid.Console” process that will be running on-premises
-  **Provisioning.Hybrid.Encryptor:** this is a little forms application that can be used to encrypt or decrypt content based on a certificate. You typically use this to do the initial encryption of the sensitive configuration data

As mentioned this project makes also use of the OfficePnPDev Core library to the actual CSOM work. Check out the documentation of OfficePnPDev Core to learn more.

# SITE PROVISIONING #
The actual site provisioning code is running in the ContosoCollaboration and ContosoProject classes. These classes inherit a SiteProvisioningBase abstract base class. The base class is responsible for providing the correct authentication provider and to provide a reference to an instantiated ClientSideSharePointService class. This last class is the class that will hold all the CSOM manipulations such as creating a site collection, enabling a feature, creating a list,…If you want to create additional “templates” then you should take the following steps
1.  Add a new template provisioning class that inherits from SiteProvisioningBase (Provisioning.Hybrid.Core project)
2.  Define a new a new constant in the SiteProvisioningTypes class (Provisioning.Hybrid.Core project)
3.  Update the ProcessMessage method in the WorkerRole class (Provisioning.Hybrid.Worker project)
4.  Add an item to the dropdown on default.aspx (Provisioning.Hybrid.Web project)

Below picture shows the important code in the Provisioning.Hybrid.Core project:

If we take a deeper look at such a site provisioning class then we can see only one method named Execute. All the site provisioning logic that you need must be triggered from this method call. A typical Excute method contains the following structure:
1.	Read configuration data, decrypt when needed
2.	Determine the site collection URL for the to be created site collection
3.	Set the status to “Provisioning” in the site directory so that the users can see that their site collection is being created
4.	Complete and verify the received site creation input
5.	Create the site collection
6.	Enable/Disable site collection and/or site scoped features
7.	Add additional lists / configure lists / add data to lists
8.	Update existing pages (add/remove web parts and/or html snippets)
9.	Create additional pages
10.	Adjust the navigation
11.	Adjust site permissions (add additional administrators, add other types of access)
12.	Set the status to “Available” in the site directory 
13.	Send a mail to notify the site owners of the site creation success. This mail contains a link to the newly created site collection

Off course these steps can be expanded with other steps such as there are:
-  Inserting of a JavaScript based hook for site customizations that are not possible via CSOM (see PnP samples: **Core.JavaScriptCustomization**)
-  Sub site creation. See sample **Provisioning.SubSiteCreationApp**

# SECURITY CONCEPTS #
From a security perspective this sample application actually consists out of 2 apps: there the SharePoint add-in that contains the UI (default.aspx) and there’s the SharePoint add-in that’s being used for the site collection creation in the Azure worker role. The SharePoint add-in for the UI is regular SharePoint add-in with basic permissions as you can see in the below screenshot of the add-in manifest:

![](http://i.imgur.com/SfQEPmS.png)

The SharePoint add-in for the site collection creation however is different: there’s no appmanifest.xml file for this add-in, so the creation of the add-in always need to happen via the appregnew.aspx page. Once the add-in is created via the appregnew.aspx page you can provide it the add-in with the needed permissions via the appinv.aspx page. Below screenshots show these two pages. First screenshot shows the appregnew.aspx page where you can generate a client ID (aka add-in ID) and a client secret (aka add-in Secret), provide a title and domain. Note that the domain you specify here does not have to be a real existing domain, just a string that’s formatted as a domain name is good enough:

![](http://i.imgur.com/X9AMdcS.png)

Use the Appinv.aspx page to lookup the add-in created in the previous step and then specify the permission XML. Given that this add-in will be used in a worker role it’s important that you don’t forget to set the AllowAppOnlyPolicy to true:

# DEPLOYMENT #

## PREPARATION OF THE AZURE TENANT ##

### CREATE A CLOUD SERVICE IN YOUR AZURE TENANT ###

![](http://i.imgur.com/sMJJ96U.png)

### CREATE A SERVICE BUS NAMESPACE IN YOUR AZURE TENANT (OR REUSE AN EXISTING ONE) ###

![](http://i.imgur.com/sVLfYXe.png)

Click on connection information and copy the default issuer (owner = default), the default key and your service bus namespace (bjansen2).

![](http://i.imgur.com/CHOI6WD.png)

### CERTIFICATE ###
Ensure you either have a self-signed certificate for your cloud add-in name (bjansen-provisioning.cloudapp.net in the sample) or that you have public trusted certificate linked to your own DNS (e.g. *.set1.bertonline.info certificate linked to bertonline.info domain name). The latter option is the preferred one and will be used in the remainder of the deployment steps.

### DNS ###
If you’re using a non cloudapp.net certificate then you’ll need to setup DNS so that there’s a CNAME of your custom domain (e.g. prov.set1.bertonline.info pointing) pointing to your Azure cloud service (e.g. bjansen-provisioning.cloudapp.net). If you don’t have DNS you can do this also by putting the IP address of bjansen-spprovisioning.cloudapp.net in the hosts file on the machines that need it. Minimally these are your test box and the Azure Cloud Service web client (only possible after deployment).

### DEPLOY THE CERTIFICATE TO YOUR AZURE CLOUD SERVICE ###
Use the Upload button in the Certificates section of the Azure cloud service you’ve created.

## PREPARATION OF THE SHAREPOINT ONLINE TENANT ##

### REGISTER THE PROVISIONING SCREEN ADD-IN IN SHAREPOINT USING APPREGNEW.ASPX ###
Your add-in domain will be the tied to the certificate as it needs to match. In this case the add-in domain is prov.set1.bertonline.info which matches the *.set1.bertonline.info certificate. If you use a self-signed cert for bjansen-provisioning.cloudapp.net then that’s your add-in domain.

![](http://i.imgur.com/KweDAHf.png)

### REGISTER THE “ACTUAL” PROVISIONING ADD-IN IN SHAREPOINT USING APPREGNEW.ASPX AND APPINV.ASPX ###
Do the same as in previous step, but in this case when entering appregnew.aspx a dummy appdomain (www.contoso.com) will be ok. Redirect URL can be left empty. Copy the ClientID and ClientSecret. Once that’s done use the appinv.aspx page to perform look of the created add-in and grant it tenant level permissions by pasting the following permission XML and press create to confirm:

```XML
<AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy="true">
  <AppPermissionRequest Scope="http://sharepoint/content/tenant" Right="FullControl" />
</AppPermissionRequests>
```

### CREATE A SITE DIRECTORY SITE COLLECTION ###
Create a site collection that will hold the site directory and in which the add-in will need to be installed. In the remaining documentation the site collection used is https://bertonline.sharepoint.com/sites/spc.

### CREATE A SITE DIRECTORY ###
The site directory is not (yet) created automatically as part of the add-in as the add-in. Quick solution is to import the sitedirectorytemplate.stp list template and create a list of it with as name Site overview.

## PREPARATION OF THE SHAREPOINT ON-PREMISES SOLUTION ##

### DEPLOY THE CONTOSO.SERVICES.SITEMANAGER SOLUTION PACKAGE ###
This solution package can be obtained from Office Dev PnP sample “Provisioning.Services.SiteManager”:

![](http://i.imgur.com/COPGBdd.png)

## PREPARATION OF THE VISUAL STUDIO SOLUTION ##
Before the solution can be deployed a number of settings have to be set correctly.

### WEB.CONFIG OF PROVISIONING.HYBRID.WEB ###
Ensure the right **provisioning screen add-in** clientID and clientSecret are set. Also comment HostedAppHostNameOverride before you deploy.

![](http://i.imgur.com/7NqQc3h.png)

Set the correct WCF endpoint URL:

![](http://i.imgur.com/ljS0tSF.png)

### PROVISIONING.HYBRID” CLOUD SERVICE SETTINGS ###

#### PROVISIONING.HYBRID.WEB ####
Go to the settings of the cloud service where you’ll see this:

![](http://i.imgur.com/MwgpRmk.png)

NOTE:
Some of the values are encrypted in the settings file. To encrypt your own take the following steps:
-  Compile the solution
-  Launch Provisioning.Hybrid.Encryptor.exe as an admin
-  Define the thumbprint of the certificate you want to use for encryption. You can take a dedicated cert or use the SSL cert. Assumption is that the SSL cert is used, if you use a dedicated cert then don’t forget to also deploy it to the cloud service as mentioned in the certificate chapter of the Azure preparation steps
-  Enter the text you want to encrypt, encrypt it and copy the encrypted text

Update following values:
-  General.siteCollectionUrl: this should point to your tenant managed path that will hold the newly created site collections
-  General.MailUser: a user in your tenant that has a mailbox. Mails will be sent from this user’s mailbox.
-  General.MailUserPassword: password of the mail user. This value must be encrypted
-  General.EncryptionThumPrint: thumbprint of the cert used to encrypt the sensitive data

Switch the service configuration to cloud:

![](http://i.imgur.com/dEzWYk6.png)

Update the general.sitedirectoryListName to point to the site collection you’ve created earlier.

Go to certificates and ensure that the entry SSL points to the thumbprint of the certificate you’re using for SSL and encryption. If you’ve a separate encryption certificate then you’ll need to add a line here and also reference the encryption certificate:

![](http://i.imgur.com/d9zp5eK.png)

#### PROVISIONING.HYBRID.WORKER ####
This is identical to the previous chapter with additional of following “All Configurations” settings:
-  AppId: clientID of your “actual” provisioning add-in
-  AppSecret: encrypted client secret of your “actual” provisioning add-in
-  Realm: realm of your tenant (use MSOL PowerShell (Get-MsolCompanyInformation).ObjectID to get this for your tenant)
-  General.SBServiceNameSpace: you’re service bus namespace (e.g. bjansen2)
-  General.SBIssuerName: the service bus issuer name (owner)
-  General.SBIssuerSecret: the **encrypted** service bus issuer secret

### APP.CONFIG OF PROVISIONING.HYBRID.CONSOLE ###
The settings in this config file are pretty identical to the once set for the Azure worker project with some on-premises specific additions:
-  General.OnPremUserName: name of an account that can create site collections
-  General.OnPremUserPassword: encrypted password of that account
-  General.OnPremUserDomain: domain of that account
-  General.OnPremWebApplication: url of the web add-in that will host the on-premises site collections (e.g. https://sp2013.set1.bertonline.info)

## PUBLISH THE SHAREPOINT ADD-IN ##

### CREATE THE ADD-IN PACKAGE ###
Ensure you’ve a correct publishing profile: best to make a new one with your provisioning screen add-in client ID and client secret. Right click the Provisioning.Hybrid.Web.SharePoint project and choose “Publish”. Use the “Package the app” option to create an add-in package. When you create the add-in package use the same domain name as used in your ssl certificate (e.g. prov.set1.bertonline.info).

### UPLOAD THE ADD-IN PACKAGE TO YOUR ADD-IN CATALOG ###
Upload the created .app file to the add-in catalog of your tenant. If you don’t know how to find the add-in catalog then use tenant administration to find out.

## PUBLISH TO AZURE CLOUD SERVICES ##
Right click the “Provisioning.Hybrid” project and choose “Publish”. Create a target profile that matches your Azure tenant and select the cloud service you’ve created before. Press Publish to have Visual Studio do the deployment. This will take around 15 minutes the first time. Subsequent runs are faster.

## INSTALLATION OF THE SHAREPOINT ADD-IN AND TESTING ##
Go the site collection created earlier on (https://bertonline.sharepoint.com/sites/spc) and install the provisioning add-in you’ve added to the add-in catalog. After installation clicking on the add-in should give this:

![](http://i.imgur.com/Od0aTEq.png)

## HOOKING UP THE ON-PREMISES PART ##
For testing purposes the on-premises farm should also have VS2013 installed. In that case the solution you’ve just created can be copied to the on-premises SharePoint 2013 server. Open the solution in VS2013 and set the Provisioning.Hybrid.Console project as start project. 

**Note:**
Ensure that the certificate used to encrypt sensitive data is deployed on the machine hosting the on-premises component. Deployment via PFX file as we need to the private key.

Press F5 to run. The Provisioning.Hybrid.Console project will now connect to Service Bus and wait for a “HBI” site creation from the SharePoint Online provisioning add-in.
