# SCENARIO: FEATURE FRAMEWORK XML BASED PROVISIONING #
This sample demonstrates how to use feature framework element xml files defining fields and content types to provision remotely structures to the host web. This is typical process when we provision site collections remotely using CSOM.

All implementation is based on the code located in the OfficeDevPnP core component, which encapsulates the processing completely. Developer will just need to provide the element xml file and call the right method.
