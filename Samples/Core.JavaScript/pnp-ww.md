Widget Wrangler
=======================================

### Summary ###
The Widget Wrangler is a light weight framework for managing the loading of javascript
"widgets" on a web page. Widgets are self contained, and and can be developed in any
JavaScript framework such as AngularJS, jQuery, KnockOut, or plain JavaScript.
Widgets are easy to reuse in multiple execution environments, such as on a
SharePoint page, in a content editor web part, in a SharePoint add-in, or outside of
SharePoint entirely.

# Introduction #
Widget Wrangler started out as a way to run multiple AngularJS applications on one page so
we could use Angular in "App Script Parts" that run in Content Editor Web parts.
It also manages the efficient loading when multiple web parts on a page 
use the same javascript extension libraries (i.e. jquery.js, angular.js, knockout.js, etc).  

Over time we've discovered that this promotes code reuse of the widgets themselves into
different environments (in a web part, on a form, in an app part, etc.) - and of parts
of widgets (such as shared Angular services).

The Widget Wrangler grew out of the
["Well Tempered AngularJS Web Part"](http://bob1german.com/2015/03/21/the-well-tempered-angularjs-web-part/)
shown at [Ignite 2015](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/2015/BRK4125).


## Use ##

The Widget Wrangler works by adding a script tag that runs the widget wrangler as the
a child element of the "widget".  For example, a widget might live in a &lt;div&gt; element;
the ww script needs to be referenced within that element. For example,

```
<div>
  <div ng-controller="main as vm">
    <h1>Hello {{vm.name}}</h1>
  </div>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="pnp-ww.js" 
          ww-appName="HelloWorld" 
          ww-appType="Angular"
          ww-appScripts='[{"src": "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.5/angular.min.js", "priority":0},
                          {"src": "script.js", "priority":1}
          ]'>
  </script> 
</div>
```

The pnp-ww script will load in-line, and will take care of loading the dependent
scripts (as declared in the ww-appScripts attribute) and bootstrapping the Angular
add-in. As you can see, the script tag has the standard "type" and "src" attributes,
which points to the copy of pnp-ww.js.  Then additional custom tags are included which
are used by the wrangler.

Tag | Required | Description
---|---|---
ww-appname | yes | For Angular widgets, the name of the Angular module that will be passed to the angular.bootstrap function when bootstrapping the widget; for self-booting widgets, is used internally by Widget Wrangler.
ww-apptype | no | Currently "Angular" is the only supported framework that will auto-bind upon load completion.
ww-appbind | no | The function that should be executed when all the script files have completed loading.
ww-appscripts | yes | A JSON object that will be used to load the additional javascript libraries.  Define a src property for each script containing the location of the script file (using ~/ in the source tag specifies the file is in the same location as the pnp-ww.js file specified above.  Priority is the load priority, this is a 0 based list of implied load order.  Multiple source files may have the same priority if they do not depend upon each other to execute.) Use the priority property to specify a numeric priority. Priorities must begin at 0 and be defined in order (0, 1, 2 ...). Multiple scripts can be given the same priority in order to load them concurrently.

NOTE: It is necessary to specify ww-apptype="Angular" OR ww-appbind="functionName".

## Examples ##

### Angular.JS ###

This example will load an AngularJS application with many dependent scripts. Notice that the priorities begin at 0
and ascend from there, and that some of the scripts can be loaded simultaneously as defined by them having the same priority.

```
<div>  <!-- This is the widget "root" -->
    <div ng-controller="ExampleCtr">
        <div>{{my.example}}</div>
        .....
    </div>
	<script type="text/javascript"
            src="/Style%20Library/WebParts/js/pnp-ww.js"
            ww-appname="ExampleApp"
            ww-apptype="Angular"
            ww-appscripts='[{"src": "~/angular.1.3.15.min.js", "priority":0},
		                    {"src": "~/jquery-2.1.4.min.js", "priority":1},
							{"src": "~/BlueMetalCommon.js", "priority":1},
							{"src": "~/jquery.jcarousel.min.js", "priority":2},
							{"src": "~/jcarousel.basic.js", "priority":2},
							{"src": "~/Example.js", "priority":3}]'>
    </script>
</div>
```

### Custom Bind Function ###

This example will load an application with many dependent scripts. This may or may
not be an Angular application; instead the developer has defined a function,
My.initWidget, that will be called to start the application. This function is always
called with a single argument, which is the DOM element of the widget root.
This can be used to write widgets in plain JavaScript, jQuery, Knockout, or other
JavaScript frameworks.

```
<div> <!-- Widget root -->
    <div> <!-- Whatever else you need -->
        .....
    </div>
	<script type="text/javascript"
            src="/Style%20Library/WebParts/js/pnp-ww.js"
            ww-appname="ExampleApp"
            ww-appbind="My.initWidget"
            ww-appscripts='[{"src": "~/jquery-2.1.4.min.js", "priority":0},
							{"src": "~/BlueMetalCommon.js", "priority":0},
							{"src": "~/jquery.jcarousel.min.js", "priority":1},
							{"src": "~/jcarousel.basic.js", "priority":1},
							{"src": "~/Example.js", "priority":2}]'>
    </script>
</div>
```

### Use in SharePoint ###
The [Provisioning.Microsurvey](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP/tree/master/Samples/Provisioning.MicroSurvey)
sample shows how to use the Widget Wrangler to load an application as:

 * A SharePoint hosted add-in
 * A "drag and drop" app script part that can be placed directly in a SharePoint site
 * A centrally managed app script part that can be used directly in many SharePoint sites and updated from a central location

The Widget Wrangler team has a test framework to exercise
the Widget Wrangler in many combinations on a web page. The tester
