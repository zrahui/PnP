# Exploring the Office 365 Groups API #
This sample is provided to aid in the review of properties and relationships of Office 365 Groups.
More information can be found in the blog post at http://www.schaeflein.net/exploring-the-office-365-groups-api/.



# The ASP.NET MVC Sample #
This section describes the ASP.NET MVC sample included in the current solution.

## Prepare the scenario for the ASP.NET MVC Sample ##
The ASP.NET MVC sample application will use the new Microsoft Graph API's to perform the following list of tasks:

-  Read list of groups in the current user's directory
-  Read the conversations, events and files in "unified" groups
-  List the groups to which the current user has joined

In order to run the web application you will need to register it in your development Azure AD tenant.
The web application uses OWIN and OpenId Connect to Authenticate against the Azure AD that sits under the cover of your Office 365 tenant.
You can find more details about OWIN and OpenId Connect here, as well as about registering you app on the Azure AD tenant: http://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/2014/07/28/protecting-an-mvc4-vs2012-project-with-openid-connect-and-azure-ad/ 

After registering the app in the Azure AD tenant, you will have to configure the following settings in the web.config file:

		<add key="ida:ClientId" value="[Your ClientID here]" />
		<add key="ida:ClientSecret" value="[Your ClientSecret here]" />
		<add key="ida:TenantId" value="[Your TenantId here]" />
		<add key="ida:Domain" value="your_domain.onmicrosoft.com" />

# Under the cover of the sample #
The application is coded against the beta endpoint of the graph api. The GroupsController class specifies the URL for each call:

```
string apiUrl = String.Format("{0}/beta/myorganization/groups/{1}/conversations/{2}/threads", 
                              SettingsHelper.MSGraphResourceId, 
                              id, itemId);
```

The user interface uses the Office UI Fabric (http://dev.office.com/fabric). There are a few custom DisplayTemplate views that handle the styling required of the fabric css.
