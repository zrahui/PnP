    <h1>Scenario 1: An Azure cloud services worker role is using the SharePoint Tenant Administration CSOM by specifying a tenant administrator user and password</h1>
    <br />
    In this scenario a SharePoint app is sending a message to an Azure queue. The SharePoint app is "basic" app with very limited SharePoint permissions (read permission on the site collection). The message will be picked up and processed by an Azure worker queue: the ProcessMessage method in WorkerRole.cs in Contoso.Azure.CloudServices.Worker will show you how the message is processed on Azure.
    <br />
    <br />
    Following aspects of the demo are important:
    <br />
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li>Credentials are created via the SharePointOnlineCredentials class (see SpoCredentialsAuthentication.cs in Contoso.Azure.CloudServices.Utilities)</li>
        <li>The sensitive data that's coming from the configuration data is retrieved encrypted and requires decryption. In this scenario encryption is implemented via certificate based encryption (see EncryptionHelper.cs in Contoso.Azure.CloudServices.Utilities)</li>
        <li>The tenant administration CSOM is used in the demo: this CSOM library makes it possible to do things like creating site collections, setting administrators,...</li>
        <li>In order to use the tenant administration csom in combination with the SharePointOnlineCredentials class some additional steps are required:
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>The Microsoft Online Services Sign In Assistant needs to be installed in the Azure worker role (see startup.cmd in Contoso.Azure.CloudServices.Worker)</li>
            <li>The SharePoint CSOM needs to be installed (see startup.cmd in Contoso.Azure.CloudServices.Worker)</li>
            <li>The worker role needs to run in elevated mode (see ServiceDefinition.csdef in Contoso.Azure.CloudServices)</li>
            <li>The web role (not used in this demo to run the tenant administration CSOM) requires that the application pool accounts are set to SYSTEM instead of the default NETWORK account (see WebRole.cs in Contoso.Azure.CloudServices.Web)</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
