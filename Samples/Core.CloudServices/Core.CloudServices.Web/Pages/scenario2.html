    <h1>Scenario 2: An Azure cloud services worker role is using the SharePoint Tenant Administration CSOM via OAUTH</h1>
    <br />
    In this scenario a SharePoint app is sending a message to an Azure queue. The SharePoint app is "basic" app with very limited SharePoint permissions (read permission on the site collection). The message will be picked up and processed by an Azure worker queue: the ProcessMessageOAuth method in WorkerRole.cs in Contoso.Azure.CloudServices.Worker will show you how the message is processed on Azure.
    <br />
    <br />
    Following aspects of the demo are important:
    <br />
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li>The OAuth token is retrieved via the AppOnlyTokenAuthentication class (see AppOnlyTokenAuthentication.cs in Contoso.Azure.CloudServices.Utilities)</li>
        <li>The sensitive data that's coming from the configuration data is retrieved encrypted and requires decryption. In this scenario encryption is implemented via certificate based encryption (see EncryptionHelper.cs in Contoso.Azure.CloudServices.Utilities)</li>
        <li>The tenant administration CSOM is used in the demo: this CSOM library makes it possible to do things like creating site collections, setting administrators,...</li>
        <li>
            In order to use the tenant administration csom in combination with the AppOnlyTokenAuthentication class app principal with tenant permissions required:
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li>Manually register an app via the appregnew.aspx page and generate an App ID and App Secret. The App title and App domain can be a simple string like "MyApp". This will provide you with the AppId and AppSecret (after encryption via Contoso.Azure.CloudServices.Encryptor) to be set in the worker role settings </li>
                <li>Use (Get-MsolCompanyInformation).ObjectID to obtain tenant Realm for adding to the worker role settings</li>
                <li>Manually set the permission XML (&lt;AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
    &lt;AppPermissionRequest Scope=&quot;http://sharepoint/content/tenant&quot; Right=&quot;FullControl&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/AppPermissionRequests&gt;) for you app via the appinv.aspx page</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
