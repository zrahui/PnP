# Core.SiteInformation #

### Summary ###
This sample is a ready-built add-in that shows information about the current site collection with a "Site Information" custom action menu item.

The interface will load in a dialog box, showing info such as: site collection admins, storage quota & usage, the Webs count, last content modified date, sharing settings, etc. It is a useful starting point if you want to build something similiar for your users.

The sample also shows how to add a custom action under the Settings menu. It makes use of the add-in Installed Event Receiver to add the custom action. For this reason it requires a publically addressable URL if installing to Office 365, or Azure ServiceBus. See below for more details.

### Applies to ###
-  Office 365 Multi Tenant (MT)

### Prerequisites ###
The complete solution requires add-in registration with tenant permissions. Refer to AppRegNew.aspx and AppInv.aspx
In order to test the add-in without deploying the Core.SiteInformationWeb project to a publicly available URL, Azure ServiceBus with ACS authentication is required. See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn275975(v=office.15).aspx for more information.

# Overview #
The add-in has several sample components:
- An AppInstalled event receiver that registers the custom action
- A dialog box to show the interface
- a simple default.aspx page with code-behind logic to get the data

Most calls can only be performed with Site Collection permissions, however some require access to the tenant. Review the code to follow the required tenant permissions calls.

## Application Settings ##
Because the solution has two interface, application settings need to be configured in the web.config of the web site application project.

```XML
<appSettings>
  <!-- The client id and client secret of the add-in as provided in /_layouts/15/appregnew.aspx -->
  <add key="ClientID" value="YOUR_CLIENT_ID_FROM_APPREGNEW.ASPX" />
  <add key="ClientSecret" value="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_APPREGNEW.ASPX" />
  
  <!-- TenantName is the registered name for the Office 365 tenant such as onebitdev2015 -->
  <add key="TenantName" value="onebitdev2015" /> 
</appSettings>
```
