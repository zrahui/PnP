# Declaratively embedding a Web Part on a page in the add-in web #

# Summary #
The purpose of this sample is to show the best way to declaratively include a Web Part on a page in the add-in web, because the best way is not the most obvious or natural way. Developers should *not* simply include WebPart markup in the ASPX page itself. Doing so can cause errors when the add-in is updated. 

Instead, the WebPart markup should be in the element manifest file (usually called elements.xml) for the page. 

### Applies to ###

# To use this sample #

1. Open the .sln file for the sample in **Visual Studio**.
2. In **Solution Explorer**, highlight the SharePoint add-in project and replace the **Site URL** property with the URL of your SharePoint developer site.

You can now run the sample with <kbd>F5</kbd>. You will not be prompted to trust the add-in because this is a SharePoint-hosted add-in and it automatically has full rights to the add-in web. The add-in will launch immediately and you will see the start page with a list view WebPart on it. There are no items in the list.
