# Introduction #
This sample is demonstrating simplistic connectivity to the Microsoft Graph to show emails and files of the particular user. UI will automatically refresh the different parts of the UI, if there's new items arriving to email inbox or added to user's OneDrive for Business site.

# Azure Active Directory Setup #
Before this sample can be executed, you will need to register application to Azure AD and provide needed permissions for the Graph queires to work. We will create an application entry to Azure Active Directory and configure the needed permissions.

- Open up the Azure Portal UI and move to Active Directory UIs - at the time of writing, this is only available in the old portal UIs.
- Move to **applications** selection
- Click **Add** to start the creation of a new app
- Click **Add application my organization is developing**

- Provide your application a **name** and select **Web Application and Web API** as the type

- Update app properties as follows for debugging
	- **URL** - https://localhost:44301/
	- **APP ID URL** - valid URI like http://pnpemailfiles.contoso.local - this is just an identier, so it does not have to be actual valid URL

- Move to **configure** page and section around keys
- Select 1 or 2 year during for the generated secret

- Click **Save** and copy the generated secret for future usage from the page - notice that the secret is ONLY visible during this time, so you will need to secure that to some other location.

- Select Office 365 Exchange Online and Office 365 SharePoint Online as the applications to which you want to assign permissions

- Give "**Read User Mail**" permission under Exchange Online permissions

- Give "**Read user files**" permission under SharePoint Online permissions

- Click **Save** 

You have now completed the the needed configuration at the Azure Active Directory part. Notice that you will need to still configure client id and secret to web.config file in the project. Update the client ID and ClientSecret keys properly.
