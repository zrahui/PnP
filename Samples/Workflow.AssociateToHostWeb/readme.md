# GENERAL COMMENTS #
Integrated workflow apps provide the capability to associate a workflow deployed in an add-in to a list in the host/parent web.
This is only an interim solution until the VS tooling has been updated to perform this activity. 


## PREPARING THE .APP FILE FOR DEPLOYMENT ##

Here are the basic steps to create your add-in, add workflows, publish the .app file and make necessary modifications that allow you to associate your workflow(s) to the host web:

- Create your SharePoint hosted add-in and then create/add your workflow(s) to the add-in project 
- Build and publish the add-in. 
- Once your .app file has been created, rename the extension to .zip
- Extract the contents
- Edit the WorkflowManifest.xml (which will be empty) and add the following:	

```XML
<SPIntegratedWorkflow xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/sharepoint/2014/app/integratedworkflow">
    <IntegratedApp>true</IntegratedApp>
</SPIntegratedWorkflow>
```
-  Once this is done save your file, and package the add-in again select all the files inside the extracted folder -> right click -> Send to -> Compressed (zipped) folder.
-  Rename the .zip file back to .app


## PREPARING THE .APP FILE FOR DEPLOYMENT ##
	
Once the .app file has been modified to include the WorkflowManifest.xml change:

- Install the add-in 
- Go to workflow settings -> Add a workflow in the list to which workflow has to be associated. 
- Now you will see add-in Selection options similar to this:

- Select your workflow add-in and continue as you would for normal workflow association
- Trigger a new workflow either by a manual start process and selecting the workflow add-in or other preferred start options.
