# Taxonomy menu #

### Summary ###
This sample shows how to create a menu that is populated from Term Store using JavaScript CSOM. The menu uses the language labels on terms and shows translated navigation nodes depending on users preferred language in user profile. This solution works cross site collections.

To set up this sample a provider-hosted add-in using  .NET CSOM creates a term group, a term set with terms in term store. Also JavaScript files are uploaded to host web and script links are added.

### Applies to ###
-  Office 365 Multi Tenant (MT)
-  Office 365 Dedicated (D)
-  SharePoint 2013 on-premises

### Prerequisites ###
It's important that the provider hosted add-in that's running the taxonomy menu is using the same IE security zone as the SharePoint site it's installed on. If you get "Sorry we had trouble accessing your site" errors then please check this.

# Step 1: Set up term store #

The first step is to set up some terms in term store that can be used by the navigation. This is all done using .NET CSOM in the TaxonomyHelper class. 

## Setup term store languages ##

To start with the code checks to see that all required languages (in this example English, French, German and Swedish) are enabled in Term Store. If not, the languages are added. This will enable language specific term labels to be created.

```javascript
var languages = new int[] { 1031, 1033, 1036, 1053 };
Array.ForEach(languages, l => { 
    if (!termStore.Languages.Contains(l)) 
        termStore.AddLanguage(l); 
});

termStore.CommitAll();
clientContext.ExecuteQuery();
```

## Create term group ##
Before setting up the terms the code checks to see if a Term Group with a specific ID exists. If not, the group is created.
termGroup = termStore.CreateGroup("Taxonomy Navigation", groupId);

## Create term set ##
Next, the code checks to see if a Term Set with a specific ID exists. If not, the Term Set is created. As part of the creation a custom property (_Sys_Nav_IsNavigationTermSet) is set to True. This is the same as checking “Use this Term Set for Site Navigation” on the Term Set in Term Store Management Tool. The property is set so that the Navigation tab will be shown on Terms to make it easy to administer Term URLs. The code also loads the Terms collection on the Term Set for later use.

```javascript
termSet = termGroup.CreateTermSet("Taxonomy Navigation", termSetId, 1033);
termSet.SetCustomProperty("_Sys_Nav_IsNavigationTermSet", "True");
clientContext.Load(termSet, ts => ts.Terms);
```

## Create terms ##
Next, the code creates the terms. For each term three language specific labels are also created. Also the custom property _Sys_Nav_SimpleLinkUrl is set which is the same as setting “Simple Link or Header” on terms in Term Store Management Tool.

```javascript
var term = termSet.CreateTerm(termName, 1033, Guid.NewGuid());
term.CreateLabel(termNameGerman, 1031, false);
term.CreateLabel(termNameFrench, 1036, false);
term.CreateLabel(termNameSwedish, 1053, false);
term.SetLocalCustomProperty("_Sys_Nav_SimpleLinkUrl", clientContext.Web.ServerRelativeUrl);
```

When the first step is completed the Term store should look like this in Term Store Management Tool:

# Step 2: Add scripts #
To demonstrate the menu on the host web taxnav.js and JQuery are uploaded to the Site Assets library. Script links are also added using CustomActions so that the files will be referenced in master page. This is all done using .NET CSOM. If building a custom branding solution with master page the links could of course be added directly to the master page.

```javascript
var customActionTaxonomy = existingActions.Add();
customActionTaxonomy.Description = "taxonomyNavigationScript";
customActionTaxonomy.Location = "ScriptLink";
customActionTaxonomy.ScriptSrc = "~site/SiteAssets/taxnav.js";
customActionTaxonomy.Sequence = 1010;
customActionTaxonomy.Update();
```

# Menu creation #
The menu is created using JavaScript CSOM and JQuery. 

## Getting user preferred language ##
First the code checks the current users profile to see preferred language. Because the property value consists of language codes (e.g. en-US, sv-SE) and Term Store uses LCID (1033, 1053) the language codes are translated using a key-value array. In production code the result could be cached to minimize client callbacks.

```javascript
var peopleManager = new SP.UserProfiles.PeopleManager(context);
var userProperty = peopleManager.getUserProfilePropertyFor(targetUser, "SPS-MUILanguages");
```

## Getting terms ##
After the code has checked that the users preferred language is also one of the languages set up in Term Store, the terms are loaded as well as the labels for that language.

```javascript
while (termEnumerator.moveNext()) {
    var currentTerm = termEnumerator.get_current();
    var label = currentTerm.getDefaultLabel(lcid);

    termItems.push(currentTerm);
    termLabels.push(label);
    context.load(currentTerm);
}
```

Finally a HTML unordered list is created and added to the DIV element with ID DeltaTopNavigation. In production code the result could be cached to minimize client callbacks.

```javascript
var linkName = termLabel.get_value() != 0 ? termLabel.get_value() : term.get_name();
var linkUrl = term.get_localCustomProperties()['_Sys_Nav_SimpleLinkUrl'];
```

The end result should look like this:

Or like this when setting French as preferred language:
